# Space Telescope Environment Distribution

This repository builds YAML files that define frozen environments (sets of packages at specific versions) for an
Anaconda installation. The [Releases page](https://github.com/spacetelescope/spacetelescope-env-distribution/releases)
provides a YAML file for each release.

2. pick a release from the [Releases page](https://github.com/spacetelescope/spacetelescope-env-distribution/releases)
   and download the accompanying YAML file
3. create a new Anaconda environment from the YAML file
   ```shell
   conda env create --file spacetelescope-env-py3.9-v0.1.0.yml
   ```
4. activate the environment
